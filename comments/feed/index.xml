		<description><![CDATA[Sorry to hear you guys are off trail, hopefully Starbucks ankle is doing better, I suppose that can take a while to heal.  I may try to sneak a permit(not likely) and summit Whitney later this month, something I wanted to do after the AT last year...that is until I became injured.  Honestly I am just now starting to feel 100% almost a year after the AT, then again I&#039;m an old man compared to the rest of you young-ins, recovery time ain&#039;t what it used to be!   

Hold your heads high, there&#039;s a lot of us out here who would give anything just to do that section you guys completed this year.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rick,

You two are rocking it! Awesome job!

I am going to be camping at Mono Hot Springs, just south of VVR from the 17th through the 24th.  If you hit Walker on day 47 that puts you at 652/47=13.87mi/day.  VVR is at 878.7, so 878.7-652=226.7 miles from Walker, which would put you there roughly on day 47+226.7/13.87=47+16.3= Day 63. Day 47 was June 5, so day 63 is  is Jun 21st (smack in the middle of my camping week).  The PCT runs past the east side of Edison lake and there is (normally) a ferry to shuttle hikers from the east side of the lake to VVR. Last season the lake was low and they were improvising with ATVs and boats; not sure what they are doing this season.

Post and let me know if your are planning a resupply at VVR, and update your ETA if you have a better guess than the 21st.  If I hear nothing I’ll plan to bike up there for a noon arrival on the 20th, 21st, and 22nd just to cover the spread. If we manage to hook up I&#039;ll buy the lunch and you can tell the stories. :)

Cheers!

		<title>Comment on Day 40: Acton KOA to a few miles after Sierra Highway by Margaret Coleman</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Ugh, that KOA sound atrocious!  I&#039;m glad we didn&#039;t try to camp there.  It sounds like the depressed economy has lead to folks used the KOA as a permanent or semi-permanent residence!  This is not the type of KOA experience I had growing up, when the KOAs were always topnotch and spotlessly maintained.  In any case, we enjoyed spending time with you in Tehachapi this week, and hope you have a great hike through Walker Pass.  That area is really interesting; I think there is a resort camp down the road.]]></description>
