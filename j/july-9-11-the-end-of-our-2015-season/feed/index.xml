		<description><![CDATA[Sorry to hear you guys are off trail, hopefully Starbucks ankle is doing better, I suppose that can take a while to heal.  I may try to sneak a permit(not likely) and summit Whitney later this month, something I wanted to do after the AT last year...that is until I became injured.  Honestly I am just now starting to feel 100% almost a year after the AT, then again I&#039;m an old man compared to the rest of you young-ins, recovery time ain&#039;t what it used to be!   

Hold your heads high, there&#039;s a lot of us out here who would give anything just to do that section you guys completed this year.]]></description>
